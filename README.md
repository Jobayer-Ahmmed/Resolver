# Navigation Links

This README contains links to all HTML pages in the `./src/pages` directory. You can access these pages using the following URLs:

- [Admin Dashboard](http://localhost:3000/src/pages/businessSide/adminDashboard.html)
- [Other Page 1](http://localhost:3000/src/pages/otherPage1.html)
- [Other Page 2](http://localhost:3000/src/pages/otherPage2.html)
// ... Add more links for other HTML pages in the directory ...

## How to Use

1. Make sure your local development server is running on port 3000.
2. Click on the links above to navigate to the respective pages.

Note: If your server is running on a different port, replace '3000' in the URLs with the appropriate port number.
